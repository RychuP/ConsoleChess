# Console Chess

Console Chess Game for the OOP course at Telerik Academy.

Original code required change of system console size and its font to run correctly.
Modified version utilizes SadConsole to remove the above limitations and improve the looks slightly.

Most of the chess mechanics are implemented apart from:
- check mate detection
- "en passant" pawn capture

Press Escape for the game menu and use mouse to move chess pieces.
