# Console Chess

SadConsole port of JustChess by Ivaylo Kenov (and, by the looks of it, his students too).

This version will work out of the box without the need to change system console size or its font.
I am also planning to add the missing menu, finish the "TODO"s and rework the input (mouse support).

Work in progress.
