# JustChess

A partial implementation of chess in SadConsole based on a repo authored by Ivaylo Kenov written using System.Console as the main rendering engine.

Most of the chess mechanics are implemented apart from:
- check mate detection
- "en passant" pawn capture

Press Escape for the game menu and use mouse to move chess pieces.
