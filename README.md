# Console Chess

SadConsole port of JustChess by Ivaylo Kenov (and, by the looks of it, his students too).

This version will work out of the box without the need to change system console size or its font.

Planned:
- add the missing menu
- finish "TODO"s
- replace keyboard input with mouse support
